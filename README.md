# Getting Started 
    This website was build by looking at Karin Bohn website: http://karinbohn.com. All pictures were taken from her website and the design        is nearly a copy. 
    There are somethings I changed when trying to replicate her her website:
      1. a lot of the padding and margins were changed for personal preference
      2. I did not add the speaker part as I believed it to be rebundant
      3. No slide show
      
# Additional Comments    
    Most of the links to the About page, blog post...etc, are directed to the home page as it is the only page I have created.
